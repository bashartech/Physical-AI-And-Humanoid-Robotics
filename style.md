Goal:
Generate a detailed, actionable task list for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook project based on the project plan, specification, and hackathon requirements.

Deliverables:
- Tasks for each module and chapter including:
    - Research tasks (literature, AI/robotics references, hardware/software specifications)
    - Writing tasks (Docusaurus-ready Markdown content, expert-level explanations, examples, exercises, mental models)
    - Technical integration tasks (RAG chatbot embedding, personalization features, Urdu translation, interactivity)
    - Testing & validation tasks (readability, comprehension checks, module-specific exercises, chatbot responses)
    - Deployment tasks (GitHub Pages, Docusaurus build, demo video preparation)
- Prioritization: high, medium, low based on hackathon impact
- Dependencies: specify prerequisite tasks for smooth workflow

Technical Details:
- Break down tasks by **phases**: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis
- Include **iteration tasks**: revise chapters after testing, integrate feedback, improve clarity, add examples
- Specify **hardware/software tasks** for simulations and edge deployment (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Jetson kits)
- Include documentation tasks: decision logs, trade-offs, citation tracking, and style guideline enforcement
- Ensure each task aligns with learning objectives, hackathon scoring criteria, and project constitution

Outcome:
- A complete, prioritized task list that guides the book development workflow, technical integration, and hackathon submission preparation, enabling a professional, expert-level outcome for readers.
