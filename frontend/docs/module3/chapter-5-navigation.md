# Chapter 5: Navigation

### Introduction
This chapter focuses on robot navigation, building upon the perception and mapping capabilities established by SLAM. The goal is to intuitively explain how robots plan paths, avoid obstacles, and execute movements to reach a desired destination, similar to how we plan a route and walk through a crowded room.\n
### 5.1 Intuition: Planning a Route\n-   **Intuition:** If you want to go from your chair to the door, you first decide the general direction, then figure out the specific steps, avoiding anything in your way. A robot does something similar but with more math!\n-   **Method:** Introduce navigation as the process of moving from a starting point to a goal point while avoiding collisions. Break down navigation into path planning and motion control.\n-   **Code Example Placeholder:** *Concept: A simple representation of a robot's start and goal positions in a 2D grid map.*\n-   **[DIAGRAM: High-Level Navigation Stack]**\n
### 5.2 Global Path Planning: The \"Big Picture\" Route\n-   **Intuition:** This is like looking at a full map and drawing the most efficient line from your current location to your destination. It doesn't care about tiny pebbles, just major walls and obstacles.\n-   **Method:** Explain global path planning algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). Discuss their use in generating an optimal or near-optimal path through a known map.\n-   **Code Example Placeholder:** *Concept: A description of an A* search algorithm's cost function, balancing distance to goal and cost of path.*\n-   **[DIAGRAM: A* Path Planning on an Occupancy Grid]**\n
### 5.3 Local Path Planning: Dodging Obstacles in Real-Time\n-   **Intuition:** Once you have the big-picture route, you still need to walk without bumping into people or moving furniture. This is the robot's real-time \"instinct\" to avoid immediate collisions.\n-   **Method:** Introduce local path planning/obstacle avoidance techniques: Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), artificial potential fields, local trajectory planners. Discuss their role in reacting to unforeseen or dynamic obstacles.\n-   **Code Example Placeholder:** *Concept: Pseudocode for a simple potential field approach, where obstacles exert a repulsive force on the robot.*\n-   **[DIAGRAM: Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) Concept]**\n
### 5.4 Motion Control: Making the Robot Move\n-   **Intuition:** Having a plan is one thing; actually executing it smoothly is another. How does the robot translate \"move forward and turn left\" into precise wheel movements?\n-   **Method:** Explain robot kinematics (forward and inverse) and dynamics. Introduce control laws: PID controllers, pure pursuit, proportional control, for executing planned trajectories.\n-   **Code Example Placeholder:** *Concept: A simplified PID controller pseudocode for steering a robot towards a desired heading.*\n-   **[DIAGRAM: Robot Kinematics and Control Diagram]**\n
### 5.5 Dealing with Uncertainty and Dynamics\n-   **Intuition:** The world is rarely perfect. Maps might be old, people might move, sensors might be noisy. How does the robot handle these surprises and still reach its destination?\n-   **Method:** Discuss techniques for robust navigation: sensor fusion, predictive models, re-planning strategies, and handling unmapped areas or dynamic obstacles.\n-   **Code Example Placeholder:** *Concept: A description of how a robot might trigger a full re-plan if it detects a significant, unexpected change in its local environment.*\n-   **[DIAGRAM: Navigation with Dynamic Obstacles]**\n
### Practical Assignment\n**Task:** You are programming a robot to navigate a busy hallway. Propose a combination of global and local path planning strategies, explaining how each contributes to successful navigation in this dynamic environment.\n
